The one true way to make badge sheets for printing

The badge app is located at <https://nicolaisoeborg.github.io/badger/>.

![Make sure to select a background without too much noise](https://i.imgur.com/fVpfAoX.png "Creating badges")

When creating multiple badges, use the "clone" button to *finalize* the current badge. From here on you can edit the copy of the badge, e.g. change name/team, but keep the settings regarding background image and color scheme. See <http://i.imgur.com/Insd5ho.jpg>.

When all badges has been created, simply press Ctrl+P (menu -> print) to print the sheet. See <http://i.imgur.com/85SzuXb.png>.
