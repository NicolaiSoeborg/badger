# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

In general, only the newest version will receive security updates.
Note that because this is a NPM project and because we depend on `react-scripts` then a billion "very low" severity issues will be found (with a very wrong "risk" score -- _no_ all those ReDoS are not medium or higher CVSS risk for this project...)

| Version          | Supported          |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Newest version   | :white_check_mark: |
| Not newest       | :x:                |
